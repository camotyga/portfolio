		<h1>Oghenetega Emagha</h1>
        <h1>Software Engineer Portfolio</h1>
		
		<h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Oghenetega Emagha, a proactive software engineering student pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire. With a focus on practical application, I've delved into ethical considerations in technology and developed Python projects like a graphical hangman game. Through coursework, I've conducted accessibility tests, ensuring software inclusivity.</p>
		<p>Beyond academics, I've engaged in professional development, participating in the Bright Network IEUK Technology programme, where I proposed tech solutions for real-world challenges. Leadership roles, such as volunteering with the Seva Mandir Foundation in India, have honed my communication and teamwork skills. My experience in fast-paced environments, like working as Bar Staff at hap Solutions Group, underscores my adaptability.</p>
		<p>Proficient in Python, with a knack for problem-solving, I'm poised to contribute to innovative projects. My interests in sports and video games not only provide balance but also inspire creativity. Eager to collaborate and contribute to impactful software solutions, I bring dedication, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learning to the field of software engineering.</p>
		
		<h2> Projects </h2>
        <p>Below are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>
        
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Python Hangman Game</h3>
            <p>This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic game Hangman. It invites players to guess a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts. The program features a graphical representation of the hangman's gallows and ambulance, progressively drawn as incorrect guesses are made. The game includes a colorful and engaging user interface, making it an enjoyable experience for players. Overall, it demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as random selection, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling while providing an entertaining gaming experience.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Graph Measures</h3>
            <p>This Python code implements graph structures and algorithms for analyzing graph traversal strategies. It defines classes for nodes, edges, and graphs, along with methods for adding nodes and edges. Additionally, it computes graph metrics such as centrality measures.
				The code includes an Agent class capable of performing random walks and finding shortest paths using the networkx library. Simulations compare random walk and shortest path strategies by measuring the average number of visited nodes.
				Overall, this project demonstrates proficiency in graph theory, algorithm design, and simulation techniques, making it suitable for showcasing expertise in data structures and network analysis.
